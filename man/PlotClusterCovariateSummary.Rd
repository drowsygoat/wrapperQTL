\usage{
PlotClusterCovariateSummary(
  se_path,
  save_dir,
  assay_name = NULL,
  filename = "cluster_summary_plot.pdf"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{se_path}{Character path to an \code{.rds} file containing a
\code{SummarizedExperiment}.}

\item{save_dir}{Directory where the plot file will be written
(created if it does not exist).}

\item{assay_name}{Optional character name of the assay to use. If \code{NULL}
(default), the first assay in \code{assayNames(se)} is used.}

\item{filename}{Output filename for the saved plot (PDF/PNG depending on
extension). Default: \code{"cluster_summary_plot.pdf"}.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns \code{NULL}. The function is used for its side
effects (writing a plot).

\description{
Reads a serialized \code{SummarizedExperiment} (\code{.rds}), computes per
\strong{cluster × sample} summaries of a chosen assay (mean and median of
non‑zero entries), and saves a combined boxplot with jittered points.
}
\details{
The input \code{SummarizedExperiment} must contain at least two columns in
\code{colData(se)}:
\itemize{
\item \code{cluster}: cluster identifier (coerced to character)
\item \code{sample_id}: sample identifier (coerced to character)
}
For each cluster, samples present in that cluster are considered. For each
\code{cluster × sample} subset, all \emph{non‑zero} entries of the assay are
taken, and their mean and median are computed. These statistics are reshaped
to long format and visualized as boxplots with quasi‑random points on top.

If \code{assay_name} is \code{NULL}, the first assay is selected and a note
is messaged. The plot is saved with \code{ggplot2::ggsave()} to
\code{file.path(save_dir, filename)}.
}
\section{Package Requirements}{

This function uses \pkg{SummarizedExperiment}, \pkg{Matrix}, \pkg{ggplot2},
\pkg{ggbeeswarm}, \pkg{dplyr}, and \pkg{tidyr}. The function checks for these
packages at runtime.
