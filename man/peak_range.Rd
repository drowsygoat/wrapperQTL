\title{Derive Significant QTL Ranges Around Local Peaks}
\usage{
peak_range(
  qtl_data,
  METHOD = "DistanceFromPeak",
  SIGTHRESHOLD = 0.01,
  SEARCHDISTANCE = 3e+06,
  LOCALPEAKTHRESHOLD = 0.01,
  MINGAPSIZE = 0
)
}
\arguments{
\item{qtl_data}{A data frame/data.table/tibble with at least the columns:
\describe{
\item{\code{chr_snp}}{Chromosome identifier (character/factor).}
\item{\code{location}}{Genomic position (integer/numeric, increasing within chromosome).}
\item{\code{FDR}}{Adjusted p-value (numeric); smaller is more significant.}
}
Additional columns are ignored.}

\item{METHOD}{Character scalar. Range-building strategy:
\itemize{
\item \code{"DistanceFromPeak"}: Define the region as the farthest significant
points within \code{SEARCHDISTANCE} bp upstream/downstream of the peak.
Significance within the region is evaluated vs. a local dynamic threshold
(\code{PEAKVALUE / LOCALPEAKTHRESHOLD}).
\item \code{"AdjacentPoints"}: Walk upstream and downstream from the peak,
extending the region while adjacent significant points are no farther apart
than \code{SEARCHDISTANCE} bp. Uses the same local dynamic threshold for significance.
}
Default \code{"DistanceFromPeak"}.}

\item{SIGTHRESHOLD}{Numeric in (0,1]. Global significance cutoff for peaks.
Iterations stop when the current best (minimum) p-value exceeds this threshold.
Default \code{0.01}.}

\item{SEARCHDISTANCE}{Numeric (bp). For \code{"DistanceFromPeak"}, the maximum
absolute distance from the peak position. For \code{"AdjacentPoints"}, the
maximum gap allowed between consecutive significant positions while extending
upstream/downstream. Default \code{3e6}.}

\item{LOCALPEAKTHRESHOLD}{Numeric > 0. The dynamic threshold factor relative to the
local peak p-value; a value of \code{0.01} means points are considered locally
significant if \code{p <= PEAKVALUE / 0.01} (i.e., up to two orders of magnitude
less significant than the peak). Default \code{0.01}.}

\item{MINGAPSIZE}{Non-negative numeric (bp). Adjacent/overlapping ranges with a gap
\eqn{\le} \code{MINGAPSIZE} are merged. Default \code{0}.}
}
\value{
A \code{data.frame} with columns:
\describe{
\item{\code{Chromosome}}{Chromosome id.}
\item{\code{PeakPosition}}{Position of local peak.}
\item{\code{PeakPvalue}}{Local peak p-value.}
\item{\code{RegionStart}}{Start coordinate (inclusive).}
\item{\code{RegionEnd}}{End coordinate (inclusive).}
\item{\code{NPeaks}}{Number of peaks merged into the range.}
\item{\code{NSignificant}}{Count of positions with \code{p <= SIGTHRESHOLD} inside the range.}
\item{\code{RegionLength}}{Computed as \code{RegionEnd - RegionStart + 1}.}
}
}
\description{
Iteratively identifies local peaks (smallest p-values) per chromosome and
grows significant ranges around each peak using one of two strategies:
\emph{DistanceFromPeak} (bounded by absolute genomic distance from the peak)
or \emph{AdjacentPoints} (bounded by the largest allowed gap between adjacent
significant positions). After collecting candidate ranges, overlapping/nearby
ranges are merged (controlled by \code{MINGAPSIZE}).
}
\details{
The algorithm loops per chromosome: pick the minimum p-value (the peak);
construct a candidate range around it using \code{METHOD} and local dynamic
threshold; remove covered rows; repeat until no positions with
\code{p <= SIGTHRESHOLD} remain. Finally, overlapping/nearby ranges are merged
with tolerance \code{MINGAPSIZE}.
}
\section{Assumptions}{

\itemize{
\item Positions are on the same coordinate system and comparable within a chromosome.
\item For reproducibility and performance, positions within each chromosome should be sorted ascending.
\item \code{qtl_data$FDR} contains the p-values to be used (adjusted). If you wish to use raw p-values,
pass them in the same column or rename accordingly.
