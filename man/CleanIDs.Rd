\title{Clean and Standardize Sample IDs}
\usage{
CleanIDs(input, Capitalize = TRUE, pattern = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{input}{A character vector of IDs, or a file path to a tab-delimited text file
where the first row contains IDs (first column is assumed to be a non-ID column name).}

\item{Capitalize}{Logical; if \code{TRUE}, converts IDs to uppercase, otherwise to lowercase.
Default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{pattern}{Optional integer vector specifying which underscore-separated parts of
the ID to keep (by position). If \code{NULL} (default), keeps all parts, but if the ID
consists of two identical halves, only keeps the first half.}
}
\value{
\itemize{
\item If \code{input} is a vector: a cleaned character vector.
\item If \code{input} is a file path: (invisibly) returns the path to the repaired file.
}
}
\description{
Cleans sample IDs by optionally selecting parts of IDs, removing duplicate halves,
and converting to uppercase or lowercase. Can operate directly on a character vector
or on the header line of a tab-delimited file (saving a repaired version).
}
\details{
If a file path is provided, the function:
\enumerate{
\item Reads the file.
\item Cleans the sample IDs in the header.
\item Writes a new file with \verb{_names_repaired.txt} appended to the name.
}

When cleaning IDs:
\itemize{
\item IDs are split on underscores.
\item If \code{pattern} is specified, only the specified parts are kept.
\item If \code{pattern} is \code{NULL} and the ID has two identical halves, only the first half is kept.
\item Otherwise, all parts are concatenated.
}
}
\examples{
# Clean a vector of IDs
CleanIDs(c("S1_A", "S2_A"))

# Keep only the first two parts of IDs
CleanIDs(c("S1_part1_part2_extra", "S2_part1_part2_extra"), pattern = 1:2)

# Clean IDs in a file and save repaired file
\dontrun{
CleanIDs("matrix_eqtl_input/SNP.txt")
}

}
